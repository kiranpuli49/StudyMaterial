Challenge #1: Complex DOM Structure
Salesforce has a complex Document Object Model, or DOM structure, in comparison to other applications. A DOM organizes all objects on a website into a type of data structure called a tree. This tree places every object in a hierarchy under another object. Because of this structure, inspecting web elements is not a simple process.


Sync issues are one of the primary reasons for our automation script failure. The sync issues may arise when we expect some event to occur. 

 Handling Dynamic Elements

New websites developed using high technologies might have dynamic content that changes over time. Even the sites that are accessible globally might contain content based on geo-locations.
For example, Amazon is an e-commerce application whose catalog changes overtime and reacts differently with different content in different regions.
